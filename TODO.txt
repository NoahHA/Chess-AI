Add en passant
	Need to start saving the previous move
	In getpawnmoves:
		If the previous move was a pawn double move
		And if the current pawn is next to the previous move's pawn
		Add a move to the position one behind where the previous move's pawn is
	In onmousedown:
		If the pawn moved diagonally and there was no takepiece
		Then take the piece behind where the pawn ended up
Create an ML Agents AI to play against
Maybe highlight the last move

To make it more efficient maybe store the game state as a 2D array of chars where each char represents
	the piece, then make moves in the 2D array and have a function to convert between the array and the
	actual board / a fen string and the array.

Add stalemate

Add draw after repeat moves

Make it so AI can't make moves that put it in check

Fix bug where screen freezes after making a move and before AI picks what to do
