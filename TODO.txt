Add en passant
	Need to start saving the previous move
	In getpawnmoves:
		If the previous move was a pawn double move
		And if the current pawn is next to the previous move's pawn
		Add a move to the position one behind where the previous move's pawn is
	In onmousedown:
		If the pawn moved diagonally and there was no takepiece
		Then take the piece behind where the pawn ended up
Create an ML Agents AI to play against
Maybe highlight the last move

MiniMax:
	Need to implement evaluate position function
	Need to save currentPosition after each turn and then 
		generate that position after minimax is called to reset the position
	Need to implement alpha-beta pruning

To make it more efficient maybe store the game state as a 2D array of chars where each char represents
	the piece, then make moves in the 2D array and have a function to convert between the array and the
	actual board / a fen string and the array.
